## Instructions for Workbook 1

Please make sure that you have read the general instructions about workbooks at $WP.workbooks.

1. Log into your GitHub account in the web browser.
2. Go to the special GitHub classroom page <special>
3. When you go to this page, it will create a private repository for you with a copy of the workbook starter files
4. In Canvas, put your GitHub user name into the text entry field for the assignment submission
5. Clone your private repository to the computer you want to work on.
6. Do the workbook - start by reading `index.html`. Read and edit the pages as you want.
7. As you work, commit your work regularly. You may want to push things back to GitHub occassionally.
8. Make sure to edit the `README.md` and `QUESTIONS.md` file
9. When you're done, make sure that all your work is committed and push it to the GitHub repo.

Note: to submit your assingment you must both push everything back to GitHub (step 9) but also submit
the assignment in Canvas (with just 1 word - your GitHub username). If you don't do the Canvas
step (step 4), we won't know to associate your GitHub account and your student ID, so we won't
be able to give you credit for the assignment!
