On the previous page, we saw a little bit of JavaScript
and saw how it can be attached to a web page.

On this page, we'll continue. We'll use JavaScript to change
page content, and make buttons and sliders do things.

The real goal is to learn the ideas of event-driven and
animation-loop-driven programming. 
Soon, we'll use these two programming styles to write graphics
programs. But for now, we'll just use them to do silly things
with the contents of a simple web page.

In the process, we'll get to see buttons, sliders, and animation.

The things we're doing on this page are simple and/or silly, but the idea is
to practice on easy things before getting to doing graphics
(next week!). 

For this page, all of the JavaScript code is in a single file
called "three.js" (not to be confused with the three.js library)
that we'll put everything for all the boxes in. Again, be sure
to read along in the code what you see in the web page.

Like the previous pages, this one doesn't ask you to do much other
than to read. However, you might want to change things to see
what happens when you make changes. Remember, if you mess things
up, you can always use GIT to help you get back to an older version.
