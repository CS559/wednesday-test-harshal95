On the previous page, we saw a little bit of JavaScript
and saw how it can be attached to a web page.

On this page, we'll continue. We'll use JavaScript to change
page content, and make buttons and sliders do things.

The goal here is to show how to use JavaScript with web pages
before we get to doing graphics stuff. Some of the things we're
doing on this page are simple and/or silly, but the idea is
to practice on easy things before getting to doing graphics
(next week!). 

For this page, all of the JavaScript code is in a single file
called "three.js" (not to be confused with the three.js library)
that we'll put everything for all the boxes in. Again, be sure
to read along in the code what you see in the web page.

Like the previous pages, this one doesn't ask you to do much other
than to read. However, you might want to change things to see
what happens when you make changes. Remember, if you mess things
up, you can always use GIT to help you get back to an older version.
