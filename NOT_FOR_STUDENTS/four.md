So far, this workbook has mainly been me writing code (and html),
and you reading it. Hopefully, you also took the opportunity to
do some extra reading (for example, reading some JavaScript references).
And some tinkering (one way to understand my programs is to try to
make changes to see how things work).

To help you check that you are getting the concepts, here are a few
little programming things to try. In each "box" I will ask you to do
something. You should edit the "four.html" and "four.js" files
accordingly to do it. These will be the things that the grader will check.

These little exercises are simple - and not very interesting.
But make sure you understand what you are doing, since they will
be the building blocks for doing more interesting things later.

And don't forget to edit the `README.md` file 
(if we don't know your WiscID and GitHub ID, we can't give you credit),
and the `QUESTIONS.md` file. 

And of course, to correctly use GIT to commit your work and push it
back to the repository on GitHub.

Note that for grading, you will get full points if you get at least
a partially right program for each exercise.
