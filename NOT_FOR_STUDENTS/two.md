You should have done [page one](one.html) already and are used to the idea of using a workbook and looking at the HTML. Now we'll add some JavaScript programming.

This page is less about JavaScript, and more to check that you understand some 
of the details as to how we connect JavaScript programs to web pages.

A secondary goal of this page is to make sure that you know how to
use the *tools* for JavaScript programming. So please try to follow
the instructions - we can't check that you did, but we'll find out
soon enough when you can't do the basic things to write programs in the
coming weeks.
