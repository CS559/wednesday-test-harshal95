    <div id="box01" class="examplebox">
        <H2>Box 1: Where does my code go?</H2>
        <p>You can put JavaScript code right into your HTML.</p>
        
        <p>
        For example, I can use a <code>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</code> tag and just
        put JavaScript right in the middle of a paragraph like this one.
        <script>
            // this is JavaScript code
            // I will do something silly
            let boxname = "Box01";
            let message = boxname + " says an initial message to the console";
            console.log(message)
        </script>
        Look into the HTML to find that JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            You should have noticed that snippet of JavaScript used the function
            <code>console.log</code> to write a message to the console.
            This is a good time to make sure that you know about the console!
            Open the console of your web browser, and make sure that you see
            the message. (It will say <em>Box01 says an initial message to the console</em>).
            To open the console in Chrome and FireFox on my Windows laptop 
            it's CTRL-SHIFT-I (the letter I). 
            If you're using Visual Studio Code with connected debugging,
            you can see the console right in a VSCode window.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also stick JavaScript code right into elements that use them.
            Here, I'll put a button right into this paragraph and attach some JavaScript
            to it.
            <button onclick="console.log('Button 1 Pressed!');">Button 1</button>
            You should look at the HTML to see the JavaScript right inline on the button.
            You should see what the button does (get used to looking at the console!).
        </p>
        <p>
            While you can stick JavaScript code right into HTML (I just did, obviously),
            you generally, should not do it. 
            For little one liners, it might be OK. 
            But, for anything more complicated, having the JavaScript in a separate file
            makes things much easier to keep track of. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Box02" class="examplebox">
        <H2>Box02: JavaScript Files</H2>
        <p>
            Since I told you not to put JavaScript into the HTML files, the next
            question is where to put it.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will put JavaScript programs into separate files - dividing them up into
            smaller chunks (roughly "modules"), but that will come later. 
            By convention, I will always name my JavaScript files with ".js", although
            other people will do other things (for example, we might name the files
            with ".es6" to signify that we're using the ES6 version of JavaScript).
        </p>
        <p>
            We load JavaScript files into our HTML page using the same
            <code>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</code> tag that we used in Box01. Except that
            rather than putting the code inline, the tag gives the file name
            to load. Look at the HTML, since I stuck it right into this paragraph.
            <script src="two.js" type="module"></script>
            You will also want to look at the file that got loaded ("two.js") and
            check the console (since, like Box1, the code writes there).
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're curious (and you should be) the <code>type="module"</code>
            in the tag tells the browser that we want the ES6 version of JavaScript.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Box03" class="examplebox">
        <H2>Box03: When to run code</H3>
        <p>
            A cool thing about the web browser is that many things are asynchronous.
            You don't have to wait for one thing to finish before starting the next.
            So, for example, when we load a JavaScript program, we don't know when
            it will finish loading. It could load immediately, or it could take some
            time (if it has to be fetched over the network, or the compiler takes some
            time). This creates a potential problem: we want our JavaScript program
            to access our web page, but we don't know if the web page has finished
            loaded (and is ready to be accessed) when our program is run.
        </p>
        <p>
            The answer to this will be to delay running our JavaScript program until
            after we're sure that the web page is loaded. 
            To do this, we'll put out program (the place to go when we want to "start")
            as a function, and set this function to be called after the window finishes
            loading. Inside the HTML file for this paragraph, you'll see an example.
            (inside the script tag) - remember you are supposed to read this!
        </p>
        <script>
            function main() {
                console.log("Box03: written after the window loads");
            }
             window.onload = main;
             console.log("Box03: written during loading");
        </script>
        <p>
            Notice how I defined a function (called <code>main</code>, that prints something), 
            and then assigned
            this function to the <code>onload</code> member of the <code>window</code> object. 
            If you look in the console, you'll see that print statement occurs 
            <em>after</em> all of the stuff that gets run during the loading (like the other
            <code>console.log</code> statement).
        </p>
        <p>
            Make sure that you're comfortable to the idea of defining functions (like we did here)
            and treating them as objects (such as assigning them to variables to be called later).
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Box04" class="examplebox">
        <H2>Box04: Multiple start functions</H2>
        <p>
            In box 3, we defined a function that got called when the window finished
            loading. If we wanted to do something else (like have a start function
            for this box) we can't just change <code>window.onload</code> again - since
            we'd over-write what we put there last time. Instead, we need to store whatever the 
            previous value was and make sure it gets called as well. An example of
            how to do this is in the box. It uses a closure - which is something that you
            will learn about as you learn to program in JavaScript.
        </p>
        <script>
            // a function we want to have run after the page loads
            function mainfour () {
                console.log("Box04: Something else to write to Console");
            }
            // define another function - just to show how there are multiple ways
            // to define functions
            let mainfourb = function() {
                console.log("Box04: Yet another line to write to console");
            }
            /**
             * define the "addStart" function that gives a new function to be 
             * called at window.onload - but first calls the old handler
             * @param {function} func 
             */
            function addStart(func) {
                // make a local variable and store the old value of the handler
                // this will be kept in closure when we define the new handler function
                let previousStart = window.onload;
                // define a new handler function and assign it to window.onload
                window.onload = function() {
                    // if no previous start was given, then its value will be undefined,
                    // so we cannot call it as a function
                    if (previousStart) previousStart();
                    // now we can call the function that we want to call
                    func();
                }
            }
            // now that we've defined addStart, let's use it
            addStart(mainfour);
            addStart(mainfourb);
        </script>
        <p>
            In the future, we will give you addStart - but I wanted to explain
            why you needed it, and to give you a first exposure to code with
            closures. While those few lines of code are short and simple, they
            use some important functional programming concepts.
            We will use similar things a lot in this class.
        </p>
        <p>
            And, in the future, don't put JavaScript into your HTML files like that.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Box05" class="examplebox">
        <h2>Box05: What to do with buttons?</h2>
        <p>
            In the first button example, we stuck code right into the button's handler
            when we created the button. That's not a good place to put code.
            Instead, what we will do to attach JavaScript to buttons is to 
            write JavaScript that finds the button on the page and changes it.
            Of course, that code cannot be run until after the page is loaded
            (since we need to make sure that the button has been created before we
            change it).
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is a <button id="Box05button">button</button>. 
            Look at the code (which is in the HTML file) to see how the handler
            is set up (and of course, check the console to see that it works).
        </p>
        <script>
            function button5handler() {
                console.log("Box05's button was pressed");
            }
            function setupButton5() {
                let button = document.getElementById("Box05button");
                button.onclick = button5handler
            }
            addStart(setupButton5);
        </script>
        <p>
            Here is <button id="button5another">another button</button>.
            The code to set it up doesn the same thing, it's just written in a 
            different style. Read the code an make sure you see what's happening.
        </p>
        <script>
            addStart(function() {
                let button = document.getElementById("button5another");
                button.onclick = function() {
                    console.log("Box05's other button was pressed");
                }
            });
        </script>
        <p>
            And while you're looking at code... Here's 
            <button id="button5yetanother">yet another button</button>.
            This one does something slightly more complicated, and makes
            use of a closure. Look at the console to figure out what
            is happeneing. 
        </p>
        <script>
                addStart(function() {
                    let button = document.getElementById("button5yetanother");
                    let count=0;
                    button.onclick = function() {
                        count = count+1;
                        console.log("Box05's third button has been pressed "+count.toString()+" times.");
                    }
                });
            </script>
            <p>
                This (the "yet another butto") example uses another closure, 
                so you can start to figure out how closures work. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But, I want you to do one other thing with this example: use it as a chance
                to try out the debugger in the browser that you are using.
                Try to put a break point in the code to stop the  program when the button is
                clicked.
                This program is so simple that you won't need a debugger, but soon, 
                we'll be writing bigger programs, and you'll be happy that you know
                how to use the debugger.
            </p>

       <div id="sumbox" class="examplebox">

           <p>
               Hopefully, seeing this gave you some ideas as to how we connect web pages
               and JavaScript programs. Now we can move on to the third page
               (<a href="three.html">three.html</a>) and try to use JavaScript to actually
               do something.
